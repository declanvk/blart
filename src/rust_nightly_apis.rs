//! Module containing copies of Rust standard library unstable functions for use
//! outside of the nightly distribution.

/// Writes a length prefix into this hasher, as part of being prefix-free.
///
/// If you're implementing [`Hash`] for a custom collection, call this before
/// writing its contents to this `Hasher`.  That way
/// `(collection![1, 2, 3], collection![4, 5])` and
/// `(collection![1, 2], collection![3, 4, 5])` will provide different
/// sequences of values to the `Hasher`
///
/// The `impl<T> Hash for [T]` includes a call to this method, so if you're
/// hashing a slice (or array or vector) via its `Hash::hash` method,
/// you should **not** call this yourself.
///
/// This method is only for providing domain separation.  If you want to
/// hash a `usize` that represents part of the *data*, then it's important
/// that you pass it to [`Hasher::write_usize`][core::hash::Hasher::write_usize]
/// instead of to this method.
///
/// # Note to Implementers
///
/// If you've decided that your `Hasher` is willing to be susceptible to
/// Hash-DoS attacks, then you might consider skipping hashing some or all
/// of the `len` provided in the name of increased performance.
///
/// **This is a unstable API copied from the Rust standard library, tracking
/// issue is [#96762][issue-96762]**
