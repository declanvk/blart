### Added

The `blart` crate is an implementation of an adaptive radix tree (ART) which is a fast and space-efficient in-memory indexing structure.

The `0.1.0` release includes:
 - An implementation of a `TreeMap` interface, mirroring the `BTreeMap` interface that `std` provides
 - Access to the raw node-level types of the tree
 - Visitor types for visualizing the tree, gathering statistics about the nodes in the tree, and checked the well-formed-ness of the tree.
 - Traits for transforming common types into byte slices to use as keys into the tree
 - Feature flags for switching between nightly APIs and stable APIs. By default the crate works with stable, but can opt-in to nightly usage in some places.

The minimum supported Rust version at this version is 1.67.

The crate is tested several ways:
 - Fuzz tests running separately on the node-level interface and the map-level interface
 - The Github Actions CI runs `miri` on the unit test suite
 - There are tests using `dhat-rs` that assert on the maximum heap usage of the
   tree, and unit tests for the sizes of the different node types.
