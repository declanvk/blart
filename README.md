## Testing

### Miri

Currently we're using some specific crates (`sptr` and in the future back to `core::ptr::*`) to ensure that we're compatible with [Strict Provenance][sp-issue]. The following `MIRIFLAGS` setup should enable checking to make sure that we're compatible.

```bash
MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-strict-provenance -Zmiri-symbolic-alignment-check" cargo miri test
```

I think this is useful because we're doing some pointer times with our tagged pointers implementation, mutating the contents of the pointer to store bits of data.

## Fuzzing

To run the fuzzer I use the command:

```bash
cargo fuzz run -j 8 -s address fuzz_raw_api -- -max_len=32768 -max_total_time=3600 && cargo fuzz cmin fuzz_raw_api
```

This will run the fuzzer for a total of 3600 seconds (1 hour), using 8 jobs (half of the total number of cores on my dev box), and using the address sanitizer. The `cmin` command is used to compact the corpus after generating new entries.

### Coverage

To generate coverage reports from fuzzing corpus:

```bash
# replace with own triple as required
TARGET_TRIPLE="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
cargo fuzz coverage fuzz_raw_api && cargo cov -- show fuzz/target/"$TARGET_TRIPLE"/release/fuzz_raw_api \
    --format=html \
    -instr-profile=fuzz/coverage/fuzz_raw_api/coverage.profdata \
    > index.html
```

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, install [`cargo-criterion`](https://github.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion), then run:

```
cargo criterion --history-id "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)-0"
```

If you get a "Permission denied" error, update perf_event_paranoid:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
```
